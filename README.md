**1. Install Python Packages:**

Before you start, ensure you have the necessary python packages. In your terminal, execute:

```bash

This will install every package that *Lumen* needs.

**2. Configure API Key:**

Insert your OpenAi API key in the <a href="src/Lumen/config.json">config.json</a> file.

```json
{
    "name": "Lumen",
    "created": "12-8-2023",
    "username": "User",
    "api" : "API_HERE"
}
```

**3. Launch Lumen:**

```bash
python .\src\LumenApp.py
```

### üéôÔ∏è How to Use **Lumen**

After Lumen is fully initialized, activate it by saying **"Lumen"** into your microphone. Lumen will then listen and respond to your prompts.

üî¥ To deactivate Lumen, simply say **"Bye"**.
